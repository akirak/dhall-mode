;; A simple repl for dhall based on comint

;;; Code:

(defvar dhall-prompt-regexp "‚ä¢ ")

(require 'comint)

(defcustom dhall-repl-executable "dhall-repl"
  "Location of dhall-repl command."
:type 'string)

(define-derived-mode dhall-repl-mode comint-mode "Dhall-REPL"
  "Interactive prompt for Dhall."
  (setq-local comint-prompt-regexp dhall-prompt-regexp)
(setq-local comint-prompt-read-only t))

(defun dhall-repl-show ()
  "Load the Dhall-REPL."
  (interactive)
  (pop-to-buffer-same-window
   (get-buffer-create "*Dhall-REPL*"))
  (unless (comint-check-proc (current-buffer))
    (dhall--make-repl-in-buffer (current-buffer))
(dhall-repl-mode)))

(defun dhall--make-repl-in-buffer (buffer)
  "Make Dhall Repl in BUFFER."
  (apply
   'make-comint-in-buffer `("Dhall-REPL" ,buffer ,dhall-repl-executable nil)))

(provide 'dhall-repl)
